# ESP32 Alarm Clock

## Overview

A DIY alarm clock using salvaged 7" LCD displays from old intercom devices, an ESP32, and (maybe) a wireless snooze button.

---

## Hardware

- ESP32 microcontroller
- 7" LCD (salvaged from intercom)
!!! warning "Undecided"
    Encountered severe issues with the intercom OS that would take too long to reverse-engineer. I'm considering moving towards a small projector rather than an LCD...
- Radio (or maybe bluetooth?) transmitter/receiver with a big ol' snooze button

---

## Features

- NTP time sync over WIFI, so the time is always accurate
- Accounts for daylight savings time
- Huge digits so my blind ahh can see the time when I'm in bed (without glasses)

---

## Build Notes

!!! note "TODO"
    Add wiring diagrams, code snippets, and images
