# docs.polimorph.dev

This is the home for all of my documentation for any and every project. A couple of things to note:
- I'd been struggling to remember the details of everything I've created over time, so I decided to compile what I remembered before it was forgotten. This project includes researching the forgotten and writing it down for the benefit of my future self. Therefore, this site is a work in progress.
- My way of doing things is not necessarily the best or most efficient way of doing things. I am a college student, after all.
- A lot of this documentation will be an archive of abandoned (and thus incomplete) projects, to serve as both a record of how I've grown as an engineer over the years, and a note of nostalgia for myself in retrospect. As such, various old projects will not be updated unless I decide to return to that project for some reason. I won't delete the old documentation, rather, I will create a new section extending the old (for the the reasons mentioned above).
- Some projects were doomed from the start. Badly thought out. Poorly designed. I'm aware. Consider: I started programming in 7/8th grade, and tinkering even before that. Of course naive decisions were made, I was a middle-schooler! So please, reserve your comments concerning poor design (etc.) for a piece of code I wrote more recently.
- If you wish to attempt to understand my thought process on some of my older projects, I wish you the best of luck!
