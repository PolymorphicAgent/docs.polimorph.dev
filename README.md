# Project Documentation

Welcome to my project documentation! **This is the home for all of my documentation. A couple of things to note below:**


- I'd been struggling to remember the details of everything I've created over time, so I decided to compile what I remembered before it was forgotten. This endeavour includes <u>researching the forgotten</u> and writing it down for the benefit of my future self. **Therefore, this site is a work in progress.**

- My way of doing things is <b>NOT</b> necessarily the <u>best</u> or <u>most efficient</u> way of doing things. I am a  student, after all. Learning is my thing.

- A lot of this documentation will be an archive of abandoned (and thus incomplete) projects, to serve both as <u>a record of how I've grown as an engineer over the years</u>, and as <u>a note of nostalgia for myself in retrospect</u>. As such, various old projects <b>will not be updated</b> unless I decide to return to that project for some reason. I won't delete the old documentation, rather, I will create a new section extending the old (for the the reasons mentioned above).

- **Some projects were doomed from the start.** Badly thought out. Poorly designed. **I'm aware.** Consider: I started programming in 7/8th grade, and tinkering even before that. Of course naive decisions were made, <u>I was a middle-schooler!</u> So please, reserve your comments concerning poor design decisions (etc.) for a piece of code I wrote more recently.


If you wish to attempt to understand my thought process on some of my older projects, I wish you the best of luck!

## TL;DR
This documentation is primarily for my own reference, but feel free to poke around if you find something useful!
